# C-LinkedList

An implementation of a singly-linked linked-list in C.

This implementation uses struct inheritance to allow the user to implement their own data-containing lists with specific data comparison and list adding functions, as explained in the source code  
  
I have implemented one child struct (llist_node_int) to demonstrate how this inheritance system works, with its own add, match, print and free functions.
